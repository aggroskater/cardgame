For a Computer Science 2 class at Texas State University.

NOTE: I'm conflicted about using Dr. Gregory's naming scheme. 
In the context of a VCS, it's bad practice. Not to mention I 
don't think splashing my ID across the web is the best idea. 
So for now, I'm just going to use the fake ID A01234567. This
will probably change as I find a better way to manage this.
