Documentation: I'll probably put it up on my personal domain at
some point.

This is for a Computer Science 2 class at Texas State University.
I'm incorporating git and doxygen in an attempt to at least start
to get a grasp on how software development is actually done in 
practice. Because writing software without a VCS and documentation
platform seems a bit like building a house with no schedule or 
blueprints. Sure you can do it, but the product is probably
going to suck. Here's to hoping this sucks less.

NOTE: I'm conflicted about using Dr. Gregory's naming scheme. 
In the context of a VCS, it's bad practice. Not to mention I 
don't think splashing my ID across the web is the best idea. 
So for now, I'm just going to use the fake ID A01234567. This
will probably change as I find a better way to manage this.
